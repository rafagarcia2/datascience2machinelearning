    "In the diagram above, we're deciding whether we should wrestle a bear that's in front of us. We're using various criteria to make our final decision, including the size of the bear, and whether escape is possible. Let's say we had a data set of people who survived bear encounters and the actions they took:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "Bear name    Size    Escape possible?    Action\n",
    "Yogi         Small   No                  Wrestle\n",
    "Winnie       Small   Yes                 Wrestle\n",
    "Baloo        Large   Yes                 Run away\n",
    "Gentle Ben   Large   No                  Wrestle\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to optimize our chances of surviving a bear encounter, we could construct a **decision tree** to tell us what action to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "As our data set gets larger though, this becomes less and less practical. What if we had 10000 rows and 10 variables? Would you want to look through all of the possibilities to construct a tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the decision tree machine learning algorithm can help. It enables us to automatically construct a decision tree that tells us what outcomes we should predict in certain situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **decision tree** algorithm is a **supervised learning** algorithm -- we first construct the tree with historical data, and then use it to predict an outcome. One of the **major advantages** of **decision trees** is that they **can pick up nonlinear interactions between variables** in the data that linear regression can't. In our bear wrestling example, a decision tree can pick up on the fact that you should only wrestle large bears when escape is impossible, whereas a linear regression would have had to weight both factors in the absence of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use trees for **classification** or **regression** problems. In this lesson, we'll walk through the building blocks of making a decision tree automatically."

    "\n",
    "Entropy, which is not to be confused with entropy from physics, comes from [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory). Information theory is based on probability and statistics, and deals with the transmission, processing, utilization, and extraction of information. A key concept in information theory is the notion of a bit of information. One bit of information is one [unit of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_information).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent a bit of information as a binary number because it either has the value 1 or 0. Suppose there's an equal probability of tomorrow being sunny (1) or not sunny (0). If I tell you that it will be sunny, I've given you one bit of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also think of entropy in terms of information. If we flip a coin where both sides are heads, we know upfront that the result will be heads. We gain no new information by flipping the coin, so entropy is 0. On the other hand, if the coin has a heads side and a tails side, there's a 50% probability that it will land on either. Thus, flipping the coin gives us one bit of information -- which side the coin landed on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy can be much more complex, especially when we get to cases with more than two possible outcomes, or differential probabilities. A deep understanding of entropy isn't necessary for constructing decision trees, however. If you'd like, you can read more about entropy [at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy).\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for entropy looks like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "We iterate through each unique value (c) in a single column (in this case, **high_income**), and assign it to i. We then compute the probability of that value occurring in the data ($P(x_i)$). Next we do some multiplication, and sum all of the values together. b is the base of the logarithm. We commonly use the value 2 for this, but we can also set it to 10 or another value.\n",

    "It may look complicated, but we'll break it down. We're computing **information gain (IG)** for a given **target variable (T)**, as well as a given variable we want to split on (A).\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute it, we first calculate the entropy for T. Then, **for each unique value v in the variable A**, we compute the number of rows in which A takes on the value v, and divide it by the total number of rows. Next, we multiply the results by the entropy of the rows where A is v. We add all of these subset entropies together, then subtract from the overall entropy to get information gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an alternate explanation. We're finding the entropy of each set post-split, weighting it by the number of items in each split, then subtracting from the current entropy. If the result is positive, we've lowered entropy with our split. The higher the result is, the more we've lowered entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "One strategy for constructing trees is to create as many branches at each node as there are unique values for the variable we're splitting on. So if the variable has three or four values, we'd end up with three or four branches. This approach usually involves more complexity than it's worth and doesn't improve prediction accuracy, but it's worth knowing about.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the calculation of information gain and make splits simpler, we won't do it for each unique value. We'll find the median for the variable we're splitting on instead. Any rows where the value of the variable is below the median will go to the left branch, and the rest of the rows will go to the right branch. To compute information gain, we'll only have to compute entropies for two subsets.\n",

Two of the values in the **high_income** column have a value of 1, while the other two values have a value of 0.

    "By artificially restricting the depth of our tree, we prevent it from creating a model that's complex enough to correctly categorize some of the rows. If we don't perform the artificial restrictions, however, the tree becomes too complex, fits quirks in the data that only exist in the training set, and doesn't generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the [bias-variance tradeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff). Imagine that we take a random sample of training data and create many models. If the models' predictions for the same row are far apart from each other, we have high variance. Imagine this time that we take a random sample of the training data and create many models. If the models' predictions for the same row are close together but far from the actual value, then we have high bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "High bias can cause underfitting -- if a model is consistently failing to predict the correct value, it may be that it's too simple to model the data faithfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "High variance can cause overfitting. If a model varies its predictions significantly based on small changes in the input data, then it's likely fitting itself to quirks in the training data, rather than making a generalizable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call this the bias-variance tradeoff because decreasing one characteristic will usually increase the other. This is a limitation of all machine learning algorithms. If you'd like to read more about the tradeoff, check out [programmer Scott Fortmann-Roe's](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html) post on this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees typically suffer from high variance. The entire structure of a decision tree can change if we make a minor alteration to its training data. By restricting the depth of the tree, we increase the bias and decrease the variance. If we restrict the depth too much, we increase bias to the point where it will underfit.\n",

    "## Knowing When to Use Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go over the main advantages and disadvantages of using decision trees. The main advantages of using decision trees is that they're:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy to interpret\n",
    "- Relatively fast to fit and make predictions\n",
    "- Able to handle multiple types of data\n",
    "- Able to pick up nonlinearities in data, and usually fairly accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "The main disadvantage of using decision trees is their **tendency to overfit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a good choice for tasks where it's important to be able to interpret and convey why the algorithm is doing what it's doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most powerful way to reduce decision tree overfitting is to create ensembles of trees. The [random forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) algorithm is a popular choice for doing this. In cases where prediction accuracy is the most important consideration, random forests usually perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next mission, we'll explore the random forest algorithm in greater depth."
