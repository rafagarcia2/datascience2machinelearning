    "## Motivating Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "You may realize that parsing this file was not different than parsing any other file from the previous missions. You may also realize that we rarely rewrite the same code twice; instead, we use a method that allows us to reuse code, **functions** such as **print()**, **type()**, **open()**, etc. Now, we formally define functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen before, a function is a packaged body of code that we can reuse by **calling** with the relevant parameters. The parameters that a function takes are called the **inputs** of the function, and the result that it returns is called the **output**. For example, we called the **open()** function with two inputs (the strings **\"movie_metadata.csv\"** and **\"r\"**), and received the output which is a **wrapper** for the file **movie_metadata.csv.** All functions follow the same road map as **open()**: They take in **input(s)**, execute the code that they surround, and return an **output**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because functions are **reusable**, we can package all the parsing we just did into one function. Then, we can call the function whenever we need to parse a file instead of having to rewrite the necessary code every time. We have been making extensive use of functions, so this should not be unfamiliar. If we had a **parser()** function, the code for the last instructions would be as concise as this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> movie_data = parser(movie_metadata)\n",
    ">>> print(movie_data[0:5])\n",
    "[['movie_title', 'director_name', 'color', 'duration', 'actor_1_name', 'language', 'country', 'title_year'], ['Avatar', 'James Cameron', 'Color', '178', 'CCH Pounder', 'English', 'USA', '2009'], [\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\", 'Gore Verbinski', 'Color', '169', 'Johnny Depp', 'English', 'USA', '2007'], ['Spectre', 'Sam Mendes', 'Color', '148', 'Christoph Waltz', 'English', 'UK', '2015'], ['The Dark Knight Rises', 'Christopher Nolan', 'Color', '164', 'Tom Hardy', 'English', 'USA', '2012']]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than reusability, there are **3 main advantages of using functions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They allow us to use other people's code without the necessity to have a deep understanding of how it was written (e.g., we use the **print()** function without reading the code inside it). We call this information hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They **break down complex logic** into smaller components or modules. Instead of writing very lengthy and complicated code, we can progress function by function. For example, if we were writing a larger piece of code, **parser()** as a function would be easier to manage rather than the code that executes the same behavior. This would make testing easier as well. We refer to this as **modularity**, which is especially important when working on teams. **Modularity makes it easier for someone else to read, understand, use, and build upon our code.**\n",
    "- They streamline our code and make it easier **to maintain**. Programmers reuse the same functions in multiple situations across a project. This means that they generalize the function as much as possible to maximize its usefulness. we call this **process abstraction**, which is an important part of reducing our code's complexity, especially for larger projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the usefulness of functions, let's see how we can write our own functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, we used **built-in** functions: **functions that Python has defined for us**. However, our toolbox is not limited to this; we can write our own functions. The syntax for defining a function consists of 5 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **def keyword** - For Python to interpret the following code as a function\n",
    "- **Name** - To refer to when we need to call the function later\n",
    "- **Arguments** - Input value(s) that the function takes in\n",
    "- **Body** - The code that the function executes\n",
    "- **Return value** - The value that the function returns to the user when the function terminates\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us examine the syntax further, using an example function that returns the first element of a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def first_elt(input_lst):\n",
    "    first = input_lst[0]\n",
    "    return first\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We start the function definition with the keyword **def**. We give the function a name that explains its use, in this case: **first_elt()**. Then, we name the single argument that the function takes. Here, we name the argument **input_lst**, suggesting to the user that the function must take in a list as input. In the next line, we define the body of the function, which consists of only one line in our case. This is the actual code that will be executed when the function is called. Finally, we use the keyword **\"return\"** to signify the end of the function, and type the variable that we want returned to the user, in this case, **first**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we should take note of the **indentation** of the function. Realize that after the colon, we indent the remainder of the function by one **tab**, which is the equivalent of **4 space bar strokes**. This is to clarify to Python what part of the code belongs to the function. Therefore, indentation makes functional differences in Python's interpretation of the code. You may notice that if you format the first line of the function correctly, so that Python recognizes that the next line will be the beginning of the function body, it indents the next line by 1 tab automatically. To make this behavior clear, you can see the diagram below and try for yourself. Notice that we do not need to press tab or space bar; Python automatically puts the indentation when we press enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"400\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1AV7PYW5SrQUPClQwskn_81dqemm9r8aN\">\n",
    "\n",
    "One other thing to note is that **first** and **input_lst** are temporary variables, which means that they are only accessible inside the function. If you attempt to use first somewhere else in the code outside the function, you will get an error saying that first is undefined. For example, observe the example below:\n",

    "\n",
    "This error occurs because first does not have a defined value outside of the **first_elt()** function. Then, in order to access the return value of this function, we set it equal to a variable, so the variable gets the function's return value. Here is the fix:\n",

    "However, you can see that this function is almost the same with **is_usa()**, except for the string they check for. This can give us the intuition that there is another layer of abstraction we can perform. If we could write a function that takes in two inputs, namely, the list and the string to check for, we could eliminate the inefficiency of writing the same code twice. Fortunately, we can exactly do that:\n",

    "Because there is more than one argument in this function, the order with which we call the arguments becomes important.

Although this is useful, there is no need for this row to be a part of our **movie_data**, and can actually cause misinformation. Let's say we want to count the number of movies in the list. Our intuition might be to do the following:\n",

This is not generalizable, so it is not a neat solution. Instead, we can use an argument that has a default value that can be manipulated, we call this an **optional argument**. Optional arguments have default values that they take on unless a different value is provided by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the default value for an argument that determines whether or not there is a header row would be **False**, because most datasets do not have header rows.

Let's modify the function to have this behavior by adding an optional parameter:\n",

    "## Calling a Function inside another Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have all the tools we need to create the statistics summary function we explained in the beginning of this section. However, we would like **summary_statistics()** to be a function itself, and re-writing all of the code inside **feature_counter()** in **summary_statistics()** defies the purpose of using a function. You may remember that one of the big advantages of using a function is **abstraction**: the fact that it saves us from having to write the same code twice. In this vein, the last feature of functions that we will use is the ability to call a function inside another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The body of one function can include a call to another function. We have already seen this, because comparison operators such as the equality operator (** == ** ) and arithmetic operations such as sum  (**+** ) and minus (**-**) are functions as well. Similarly, we can call built-in or user-created functions by making their return values equal to a variable in the outer function, so that we can use that variable in the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to build a function **list_counter()** that will count the elements in multiple lists, and make a separate list holding these values. This is how we want the function to operate:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> lists = [[\"dog\",\"cat\",\"rabbit\"],[1,2,3,4],[True]]\n",

    "    return final_list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, we called the user-defined function **counter()** and assigned its return value to **num_elt**. Each time the for loop starts, the counter will be called with a different argument (the current value assigned to **each**), and return a different value. Whenever we define a new function, we can call it inside another function using this syntax.\n",

    "As we begin to take greater advantage of functions to organize our code, it can become more complex. We need to better understand the kinds of mistakes we can make when writing it. We've talked briefly about errors, or mistakes that prevent our code from working as we expect, in previous missions. Now it's time to learn more about them.\n",

If the interpreter encounters any code that doesn't adhere to Python's language rules, it halts the parsing and returns an error. Rich coding environments like [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Jupyter Notebook ](https://jupyter.org/) help us prevent these types of errors through syntax highlighting - a feature that displays different parts of our code (such as brackets) in different colors. Syntax highlighting makes it easier to read our code and spot errors. Some examples of syntax errors include:\n",

While we can also create separate functions to calculate the totals for the **year** and **date_of_month** columns, it's better to create a single function that works for any column and specify the column we want as a parameter each time we call the function.\n",

    "1. Write a function that can calculate the **min** and **max** values for any dictionary that's passed in.\n",
    "2. Write a function that extracts the same values across years and calculates the differences between consecutive values to show if number of births is increasing or decreasing.\n",
    "  - For example, how did the number of births on Saturday change each year between 1994 and 2003?\n",
    "3. Find a way to combine the CDC data with the SSA data, which you can find [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/births). Specifically, brainstorm ways to deal with the overlapping time periods in the datasets."
