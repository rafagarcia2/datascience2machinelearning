    "Software is constantly evolving, so data scientists need a way to **update** the software they are using without breaking things that already work. **Conda** is an open source, **cross-platform tool for managing packages and working environments** for many different programming languages. This lesson explains how to use its core features to manage your software so that you and your colleagues can reproduce your working environments reliably with minimum effort."

    "# Installing packages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conda** packages are files containing a bundle of resources: usually libraries and executables, but not always. In principle, **Conda** packages can include data, images, notebooks, or other assets. The command-line tool **conda** is used to install, remove and examine packages; other tools such as the GUI Anaconda Navigator also expose the same capabilities. This course focuses on the **conda** tool itself (you'll see use cases other than package management in later chapters).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conda** packages are most widely used with Python, but that's not all. Nothing about the Conda package format or the **conda** tool itself assumes any specific programming language. **Conda** packages can also be used for bundling libraries in other languages (like R, Scala, Julia, etc.) or simply for distributing pure binary executables generated from any programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the powerful aspects of conda—both the tool and the package format—is that dependencies are taken care of. That is, when you install any **Conda** package, any other packages needed get installed automatically. Tracking and determining software dependencies is a hard problem that package managers like **Conda** are designed to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Conda** package, then, is a file containing all files needed to make a given program execute correctly on a given system. Moreover, a **Conda** package can contain binary artifacts specific to a particular platform or operating system. Most packages (and their dependendencies) are available for Windows (win-32 or win-64), for OSX (osx-64), and for Linux (linux-32 or linux-64). A small number of **Conda** packages are available for more specialized platforms (e.g., Raspberry Pi 2 or POWER8 LE). As a user, you do not need to specify the platform since **Conda** will simply choose the **Conda** package appropriate for the platform you are using.\n",

Often this \"satisfiability\" constraint depends on choosing a package version compatible with a particular version of Python that is installed.

Obviously, at other times updating will do nothing because you are already at the latest version possible.\n",
