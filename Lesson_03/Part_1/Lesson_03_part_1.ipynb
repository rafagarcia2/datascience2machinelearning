    "\n",
    "In the previous cell, we wrote our own implementation that found the average of a list. Rather than writing our own implementation every time, luckily, someone else has likely already written an implementation as a **module**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a collection of functions and variables that have been bundled together in a single file. This single file, is generally centered around a specific theme. There are modules that focus on [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) operations, audio files ([audioop](https://docs.python.org/3/library/audioop.html)), image processing ([pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules improve the readability of our code by abstracting away the implementation while allowing us to understand exactly what the code does. Let's take an example of **sum()**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "l = [66,44,22]\n",
    "sum(l)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we can't see the code underneath the **sum()**. However, we know exactly what the code does in one line.\n",
    "\n",
    "To load a module, we'll use the **import** statement. For readability, it's usually a good idea to import the modules we'll need in the beginning of our script.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When importing a module, we then get access to all the functions and variables within the module. Let's look at a sample implementation of two functions: **sum()** and **exp()**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def total(input):\n",
    "    total = 0\n",

Generally, whenever you use a module, it's good practice to reference the documentation. In this mission, we'll be using the [statistics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html) and [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) modules.
