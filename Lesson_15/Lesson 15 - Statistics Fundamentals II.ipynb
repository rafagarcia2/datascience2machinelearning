    "For variables measured on a **nominal** or an **ordinal** scale it's common to use a **bar plot** to visualize their distribution. To generate a **bar plot** for the distribution of a variable we need two sets of values:\n",

    "Another kind of graph we can use to visualize the distribution of **nominal** and **ordinal** variables is a **pie chart**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as the name suggests, a pie chart is structured pretty much like a regular pie: it takes the form of a circle and is divided in wedges. Each wedge in a pie chart represents a category (one of the unique labels), and the size of each wedge is given by the proportion (or percentage) of that category in the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1KKprkhfZaGe0CkLO0p3FzoJ6i71QrSv-\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generate pie charts using the [Series.plot.pie() method](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.plot.pie.html). This is how we'd do that for the **Pos** variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">> wnba['Pos'].value_counts().plot.pie()\n",
    "```\n",

    "<img width=\"400\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1MvVv73TYBDN5VNZ2gELxp5I4O3bn6UJC\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of pie charts over bar plots is that they provide a much better sense for the relative frequencies (proportions and percentages) in the distribution. Looking at a bar plot, we can see that categories are more or less numerous than others, but it's really hard to tell what proportion in the distribution each category takes.\n",
    "\n",
    "With pie charts, we can immediately get a visual sense for the proportion each category takes in a distribution. Just by eyeballing the pie chart above we can make a series of observations in terms of proportions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Guards (\"G\") take about two fifths (2/5) of the distribution.\n",
    "- Forwards (\"F\") make up roughly a quarter (1/4) of the distribution.\n",
    "- Close to one fifth (1/5) of the distribution is made of centers (\"C\").\n",
    "- Combined positions (\"G/F\" and \"F/C\") together make up roughly one fifth (1/5) of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "- Generate a pie chart to visualize the distribution of the **Exp_ordinal** variable.\n",
    "  - Generate a frequency table for the **Exp_ordinal** variable. Don't sort the table this time.\n",
    "  - Use the **Series.plot.pie()** method to generate the pie plot."

    "To give a pie chart the right shape, we need to specify equal values for height and width in the **figsize** parameter of **Series.plot.pie()**. The **Exp_ordinal** is the label of a hidden y-axis, which means we can use the **plt.ylabel()** function to remove it. This is how we can do this for the **Pos** variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    ">> wnba['Pos'].value_counts().plot.pie(figsize = (6,6))\n",

    "Ideally, we'd have proportions or percentages displayed on each wedge of the pie chart. Fortunately, this is easy to get using the **autopct** parameter. This parameter accepts Python string formatting, and we'll use the string **'%.1f%%'** to have percentages displayed with a precision of one decimal place. Let's break down this string formatting:\n",

    "Notice that the percentages were automatically determined under the hood, which means we don't have to transform to percentages ourselves using **Series.value_counts(normalize = True) * 100.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Other display formats are possible, and more documentation on the the syntax of string formatting in Python can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language).

    "It should now be clear that a histogram is basically the visual form of a grouped frequency table. Structurally, a histogram can also be understood as a modified version of a bar plot. The main difference is that in the case of a histogram there are no gaps between bars, and each bar represents an interval, not a single value.\n",

    "The main reason we remove the gaps between bars in case of a histogram is that we want to show that the class intervals we plot are adjacent to one another. With the exception of the last interval, the ending point of an interval is the starting point of the next interval, and we want that to be seen on the graph.\n",

    "You might have noticed that **Series.plot.hist()** splits a distribution by default into 10 class intervals. In the previous mission, we learned that 10 is a good number of class intervals to choose because it offers a good balance between information and comprehensibility.\n",

    "With histograms, the breakdown point is generally larger than 10 because visualizing a picture is much easier than reading a grouped frequency table. However, once the number of class intervals goes over 30 or so, the granularity increases so much that for some intervals the frequency will be zero. This will result in a discontinued histogram from which is hard to discern patterns.\n",

    "To modify the number of class intervals used for a histogram, we can use the **bins** parameter of **Series.plot.hist()**. A bin is the same thing as a class interval, and, when it comes to histograms, the term \"bin\" is used much more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we'll often want to avoid letting pandas work out the intervals, and use instead intervals that we think make more sense. We can do this in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We start with specifying the range of the entire distribution using the **range** parameter of **Series.plot.hist().**\n",

    "- [200, 400)\n",
    "- [400, 600]\n",
    "\n",
    "If the histogram ranges from 1 to 600, and we specify that we want three bins, then the bins will automatically take the intervals above. This is because the bins must have equal interval lengths, and, at the same time, cover together the entire range between 1 and 600. To cover a range of 600 with three bins, we need each bin to cover 200 points, with the first bin starting at 1, and the last bin ending at 600.\n",

    "When we say that the distribution above resembles closely a normal distribution, we mean that most values pile up somewhere close to the middle and decrease in frequency more or less gradually toward both ends of the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar reasoning applies to skewed distributions. We don't see very often clear-cut skewed distributions, and we use the left and right skewed distributions as baselines for comparison. For instance, we'd say that the distribution of the **BMI** variable is slightly **right skewed**:\n",

    "Comparing the **five distributions** is now easier, and we can make a couple of observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There's only one **rookie** playing on a combined position **(F/C)**. This is significantly less compared to more experienced players, which suggests that combined positions (**F/C** and **G/F**) may require more complex skills on the field that rookies rarely have.\n",
    "- Rookies are the only category where we don't find players on all positions. We can see there are no rookies who play on a G/F position.\n",
    "- Guards predominate for every level of experience. This probably means that most players in a basketball team are guards. It's worth examining the distributions of a couple of teams to find whether this is true. If it's true, it might be interesting to find out why teams need so many guards.\n",
